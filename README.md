# Multi-threaded RTOS Architecture for RC-Piloted-Vehicle  
This was project was created by my team and I that consisted of the NXP-KL25Z which is a microcontroller based on ARM Cortex-M Cores. Along with this we used a car chasis kit, provided by the university that was used to construct the assembly-frame of the vehicle. The vehicle was controlled using a simple application made using the MIT app-inventor and communicated with the car via the bluetooth module.
